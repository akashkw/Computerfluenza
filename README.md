VIRUSES OOOKIE SPOOKIE

funcvirus - Run on Mac or Linux
-creates and calls a recursive function without base case as a bash script.

aspervirus & selfcalling thingy- Run on Mac or Linux
-forks itself and puts these forks in the background, with an added image display and beeps.

keepRunning.sh & rotate.py - Run on Ubuntu
-the python code executes a subprocess every 5 seconds to rotate your screen.
-the python code, if executed by itself, will then not respond to Ctrl-C or Ctrl-V, but will however stop if you close the terminal (my first line of attack).
-But I don't want you to have it that easy, so you should run keepRunning.sh instead, which utilizes nohup, so that programs ignore hangup signals.
-Have fun searching through top sideways (if I wanted to have less fun, then I would have had there be no display, which is an option of the command that I used. However, more fun = better).
